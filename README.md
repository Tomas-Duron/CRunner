# CRunner
## Description
I created a little script to help streamline the creation of programs in C, as well as run other actions on files.

This was created because I didn't like having to navigate to a folder, compile the program, and run the program in multiple commands so I created this to run programs in one command.

## Todo
Make it so that you don't need to change .out and .exe based on the system you're working with.
